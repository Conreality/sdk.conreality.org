Conreality Software Development Kit (SDK) for .NET
**************************************************

The Conreality SDK for .NET is currently at a planning stage at:
https://github.com/conreality/conreality.net

.. note::

   Pending the release of a Conreality SDK for the .NET Framework, you can
   integrate C#/F#/.NET software with Conreality games by issuing SQL commands
   over the PostgreSQL network protocol (via a PostgreSQL library).
   Refer to the documentation for the :doc:`Conreality SDK for SQL </sql/index>`.
