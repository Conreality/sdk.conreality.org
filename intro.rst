The Conreality Software Development Kit (SDK) is a toolkit meant for
developers who wish to integrate third-party software into Conreality games,
or to otherwise extend game scenarios past the limitations of the scripting
language sandbox provided by the Conreality Game Development Kit (GDK).

Unlike with the GDK, previous software development experience and competence
is assumed and required to be able to understand and to work with the SDK.
