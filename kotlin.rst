Conreality Software Development Kit (SDK) for Kotlin

.. note::

   Until there is a dedicated Conreality SDK for Kotlin, you can integrate
   Kotlin software with Conreality games by issuing SQL commands over the
   PostgreSQL network protocol (e.g., via the PgJDBC_ library).
   Refer to the documentation for the :doc:`Conreality SDK for SQL <sql>`.

.. _PgJDBC: https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc
