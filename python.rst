Conreality Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python
****************************************************

.. note::

   Until there is a dedicated Conreality SDK for Python, you can integrate
   Python software with Conreality games by issuing SQL commands over the
   PostgreSQL network protocol (e.g., via the Psycopg2_ or asyncpg_ libraries).
   Refer to the documentation for the :doc:`Conreality SDK for SQL <sql>`.

.. _Psycopg2: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2
.. _asyncpg:  https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg
