Conreality Software Development Kit (SDK) for Ruby
**************************************************

.. note::

   Until there is a dedicated Conreality SDK for Ruby, you can integrate
   Ruby software with Conreality games by issuing SQL commands over the
   PostgreSQL network protocol (via the Pg_ library).
   Refer to the documentation for the :doc:`Conreality SDK for SQL <sql>`.
